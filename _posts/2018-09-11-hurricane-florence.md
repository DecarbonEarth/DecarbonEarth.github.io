title: Hurricane Florence A Once in a Lifetime Storm
---

<img align="right" src="/images/HurricaneFlorence.png">The National Weather Service is describing Hurricane Florence, currently bearing down on the Carolinas, as [the storm of a lifetime.](https://abcnews.go.com/US/million-people-evacuated-coast-hurricane-florence-bears/story?id=57740845)

People should take it seriously. Evacuate to locations further inland. Don't try to ride out the storm...

...but it won't be the storm of a lifetime. Florence won't even be the storm of the season, bigger storms are coming.

Global Warming is real, it is here, and it has consequences. Warmer oceans are leading to much bigger storms much more frequently than we have dealt with before. This is the new normal. Our lifetimes will see much, much more severe storms, because the planet is still warming.
