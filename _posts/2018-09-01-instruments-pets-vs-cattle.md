title: Measurement Instruments and Pets vs Cattle

The [pets vs cattle](http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/)
analogy is often used to explain cloud computing and modern datacenters.
If a server is unique, loaded with important data, fitted out with special
peripherals or computing, or otherwise special then we end up treating it like
a pet. It is carefully monitored and if something goes wrong we swing into
action to repair it and restore it to service. By contrast, datacenter servers
are cattle. If something goes wrong with a server its workload gets shifted
to one of the other servers while the original is slated for replacement.

Right now, most instruments used for analysis of carbon in soils are treated
like pets. They are expensive, they require skilled operators, they utilize
radioactive components, and other factors which cause them to be either
confined to a lab with soil samples brought to them, or to always be accompanied
by trained technicians.

We're working to make sensors and instruments which can be treated like cattle
rather than pets. Inexpensive, replaceable, and performing the raw measurements
in the field with analysis in the cloud, these devices can be shipped wherever
they need to be and can provide measurements at much more frequent intervals
at much lower costs.
