title: Handling Anomalies
---

When measuring soil carbon sequestration, there will be anomolies. For example
biochar soil additives are becoming more common, and will result in powdered
carbon granules in the soil. Though technically these are increases in the carbon
level of the soil and should be beneficial to plant growth, they do not represent
new carbon sequestration. In terms of a carbon credit schedule, soil additives
don't count.

We believe there are techniques which can distinguish soil additives from
biological carbon content based on their physical and electrical properties.
By reporting all of the raw measurements back for processing, we expect to be
able to apply both normal analysis techniques as well as machine learning across 
the whole corpus of data to flag unusual results.

An advantage of performing the analysis in the datacenter is that old data can be
re-analyzed using new techniques. If results are suspect, whether innocuous or
deliberate, older measurements from that property can be re-analyzed to try to
determine when the anomalies began.
